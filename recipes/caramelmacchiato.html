<h1>Caramel Macchiato</h1>

<img src="" alt="The finished product &#8212; the iconic Caramel Macchiato!" />

<p>An iconic coffee shop favorite: milk* subtly sweetened with vanilla, topped with 
bold and robust espresso, and finely garnished a thick layer of buttery caramel for the 
finishing touch. This beverage can be enjoyed hot or iced.</p>

<p><small>* or non-dairy alternative preference</small></p>

<p>It should be noted that this recipe follows the traditional, hot version of the 
beverage. The iced variation can be made with a few different steps which will be outlined 
below this recipe.</p>


<h3>Gather your ingredients!</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Espresso or hot, freshly brewed coffee</li>
    <li>Milk (or cream, or non-dairy alternative... your choice)</li>
    <li>Vanilla Syrup or Vanilla Bean Powder</li>
    <li>Caramel Sauce</li>
</ul>

<h4>Make something awesome!</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare your milk. We want to achieve a velvety, smooth texture while paying careful 
    attention to temperature so not to scald our milk or burn ourselves. There are several different 
    ways to prep the milk; if you have an espresso machine or at-home setup, simply follow the routine standards as 
    specified by manufacturer instructions. Alternatively, the milk can be prepared with a hand-held 
    milk frother or old-fashioned microwave or stovetop methods, whichever you're most comfortable with.</li>
    
    <li>Pay attention to not overheat the milk. Scalding the milk like this takes away from the sweetness we're looking for. 
    As a general rule of thumb, you can "check" by paying attention to the bubbles that form during the heating process. 
    Pay attention to the bubbles that form around the walls of the container. Smaller, minor bubbles are fine; larger, 
    bulkier bubbles indicate that you've scalded the milk and should start over.</li>
    
    <li>Once you've finished prepping the milk, add 1-2 tablespoons of vanilla syrup to your mug or cup; more or less to taste.</li>
    
    <li>Pour your milk into the cup. If you don't have vanilla syrup, you can skip the previous step and instead stir some vanilla bean 
    powder into the milk. Leave room at the top of the cup though, we still need to add our coffee and caramel sauce!</li> 
    
    <li>While the vanilla and milk incorporate and your milk cools down a bit, start pulling your espresso shot(s) or brewing your coffee. It is important 
    that the coffee is freshly extracted for that bold flavor profile we want to achieve. Slowly pour the coffee over the milk.</li>
    
    <li>Drizzle caramel sauce over the coffee and milk, to your taste. Remember, it will incorporate into the rest of the 
    drink, and you can always add more if you're looking for something sweeter, but you can't take it away.</li>
    
    <li>Check that your beverage is at a comfortable temperature to consume and enjoy!</li>
