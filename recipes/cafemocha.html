<p>Another coffee shop classic! Bold, espresso fused with milk, dark or white 
chocolate! It's the adult version of a hot chocolate &#8212; that is, hot chocolate with 
a special kick: coffee. This beverage can be enjoyed hot or cold.</p>

<p><small>* or non-dairy alternative preference</small></p>

<p>It should be noted that this recipe follows the traditional, hot version of the 
beverage. The iced variation can be made with a few different steps which will be outlined 
below this recipe.</p>


<h3>Gather your ingredients!</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Espresso or hot, freshly brewed coffee</li>
    <li>Milk (or cream, or non-dairy alternative... your choice)</li>
    <li>Chocolate Sauce or Syrup</li>
    <li>Whipped Cream [or non-dairy option] (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Make something awesome!</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare your milk. We want to achieve a velvety, smooth texture while paying careful 
    attention to temperature so not to scald our milk or burn ourselves. There are several different 
    ways to prep the milk; if you have an espresso machine or at-home setup, simply follow the routine standards as 
    specified by manufacturer instructions. Alternatively, the milk can be prepared with a hand-held 
    milk frother or old-fashioned microwave or stovetop methods, whichever you're most comfortable with.</li>
    
    <li>Pay attention to not overheat the milk. Scalding the milk like this takes away from the sweetness we're looking for. 
    As a general rule of thumb, you can "check" by paying attention to the bubbles that form during the heating process. 
    Pay attention to the bubbles that form around the walls of the container. Smaller, minor bubbles are fine; larger, 
    bulkier bubbles indicate that you've scalded the milk and should start over.</li>
    
    <li>Start pulling your espresso shots or brewing your coffee. While that is happening, start adding your 
    chocolate syrup or sauce to your cup. Once the shot or coffee has finished brewing pour it over the chocolate, 
    making sure you give it a good stir so the chocolate incorporates into the coffee smoothly.
    You're not limited to using only chocolate sauce, you can use white chocolate, dark chocolate, whatever you like. 
    This recipes aims to serve as a very basic "guide" or "model" to follow, and all ingredients do not have to 
    be exact; make it to <em>your</em> liking!</li>

    <li>Pour in milk and stir until all ingredients are well combined.</li>

    <li>As always, ensure your beverage is a comfortable temperature for consumption and enjoy!</li>

    <li>For added sweetness, you can top your beverage with a bit of whipped cream... perhaps some 
    chocolate candies or cookies? Might as well endulge, right?</li>
    </li>

    <li><strong>For the iced variation:</strong> skip milk preparation completely. Stir cold 
    milk or non-dairy alternative into coffee and sauce base. Leave room for ice &#8212; 
    it really is that easy!</li>
